# Elevator Pitch: Podcast Library Platform

## What I'm Building

I'm building **Podcast Library** — a full-stack podcast discovery and playback platform. Think of it like a modern, searchable library for podcasts where users can browse thousands of shows, listen to episodes, and discover new content. It's similar to Spotify for podcasts, but focused on discovery and curation.

The platform has three main parts:
- **Web App**: A beautiful, fast website where people browse and play podcasts (built with Next.js)
- **iOS App**: A native iPhone app for listening on the go (built with SwiftUI)
- **Backend**: Automated systems that pull in new podcast episodes from RSS feeds and store everything in a database

## How Cursor Helps Me

**Cursor is my AI pair programmer** that makes building this complex platform way faster and less overwhelming. Here's how:

- **Code Generation**: When I need a new feature (like search, filtering, or audio playback), I describe what I want in plain English and Cursor writes the code for me
- **Context Awareness**: Cursor understands my entire codebase, so it can suggest changes that fit with my existing architecture
- **Debugging**: When something breaks, I can ask Cursor "why isn't this working?" and it analyzes the code to find the issue
- **Refactoring**: Cursor helps me clean up and improve code across multiple files at once, keeping everything consistent

Instead of spending hours googling solutions or writing boilerplate code, I can focus on the creative parts: designing features, improving user experience, and making the platform better.

## Technical Stack (Simple Version)

**Frontend:**
- Next.js (React framework) for the web app — gives me SEO-friendly pages and fast performance
- Vanilla JavaScript for the podcast player — keeps it lightweight and fast
- SwiftUI for the iOS app — Apple's modern UI framework

**Backend:**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database) — stores all podcasts, episodes, and metadata
- Python scripts — automatically fetch new episodes from RSS feeds every few hours

**Infrastructure:**
- Vercel — hosts the web app (automatic deployments)
- Google Analytics — tracks how people use the site

The beauty is that most of this "just works" — I don't have to manage servers or worry about scaling. I can focus on building features instead of infrastructure.

## Why This Matters

Podcasts are exploding in popularity, but discovery is still hard. Most platforms lock you into their ecosystem or have clunky interfaces. I'm building something open, fast, and focused purely on helping people find and enjoy great audio content.

---

**TL;DR**: Building a podcast platform with web + iOS apps. Cursor writes most of my code so I can focus on features instead of syntax. Using modern tools (Next.js, Supabase, SwiftUI) that handle the hard parts automatically.
